      <p class="paragraph mt-10">I'm a <span class="paragraph-3">front-end developer</span> who loves building <span class="paragraph-2">websites</span> and <span class="paragraph-2">web apps</span>, enjoys <span class="paragraph-1">writing</span> blogs and likes <span class="paragraph-1">designing</span> logos. I'm also into sharing tech trivias through creative digital content. Most of these days, I've been building mini web apps with <span class="paragraph-3">Vue</span> and exporing different <span class="paragraph-3">design frameworks</span> like <span class="font-weight-bold">Tailwind</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">Vuetify</span>.</p>

      <p class="paragraph mt-10"><span class="paragraph font-weight-bold">I'm currently interested in learning more about API integration and delving deeper into mobile responsiveness.</span> Aside from programming, I'm also doing makeup and learning from famous beauty gurus' creations. I stay fit through my childhood exercise tools: jumping rope and hulahoop. Iâ€™m also a low-rank League of Legends player but plays anyway.</p>
